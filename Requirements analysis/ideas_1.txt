1.Lego Based Data Structure :
-> computer vision based detection system 
-> the Logo elements will be detected by the camera 
-> depending on the orientation and the color 
-> the web page will be updated 



2. Block based Data Structure :
-> wooden or any material block will be treated as  the data for the data structure 
-> The block will have the Screen , sensors and the battery in its own 
-> This block will be connected to the environment 
-> environment will be a space : a box or a container 
-> the container will be having the then sending the data to the web server 
-> the web server will be using the technology such as websockets 
-> then the web sockets will be updating the web page 
-> the live update on the web page 
 
3.
 -> vr and ar integration 
 -> all of the above only but the ar model will move as per the movement 
->Create a system where physical blocks equipped with sensors send data to a web server.
->The server updates an AR/VR interface to provide real-time, 
->immersive visualization of the data.
